# c-platformer

This is an attempt at making an ncurses platformer in C to
refresh my C programming abilities and learn something new.

## Usage

To compile:
```shell
make
```

To cleanup:
```shell
make clean
```

To run:
```
./main
```

## Development

Put `.c` files (source code) in `src/`.

Put `.h` files (headers) in `include/`.
